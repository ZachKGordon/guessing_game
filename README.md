Favorite Food Game

The game I created uses 3 if/else statements.

The first part has two if/else statements and asks what my favorite food is with a prompt, "what's my favorite food?". If input is correct, a winning message appears and user moves to part 2. If wrong, a try again message with a hint appears. After the hint, the user answers again and if now right, a winning message appears and moves to part two, if wrong, you lose the fist part and then move to part two.

The second part uses one if/else statement. Prompt asks the user to guess my age. If below 27, a "wrong" prompt is displayed and game over. If guessed correct a "winning" prompt appears, game over. Finally if guessed above 27 a "wrong" prompt is displayed and game over.

The third part of the game asks the user to guess what city I am from.  An incorrect answer produces one answer, while the correct answer produces a sarcastic response
Format below.
